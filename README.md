>  <h2> This is my SIEM/Honey Pot (unsecured network) with a live dashboard. <h2/>

This network was created within a VIrtual Machine in Azure, is open to the internet, with the firewall disabled.

Each attacker that tries to gain access to this network is logged, their data is parsed, and displayed within a dashboard.

The dashboard displays the location of the attackers, as well as the number of attempts.

Applications used - Microsoft Azure, Sentinel, Powershell, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Windows Event Viewer, and Geolocation API tool.

If you would like to view the live version of this SIEM Dashboard, let me know and I can grant you access to the resource within Azure.

<b>More notes, updates, and screenshots coming soon. <b/>
