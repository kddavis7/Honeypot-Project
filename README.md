# SIEM - Honeypot-Project
This is my SIEM/Honey Pot (unsecured network) with a live dashboard.

This network is open to the internet, with no the firewall turned off.

Each attacker that tries to gain access to this network is logged, and displayed within a dashboard.

I created this HoneyPot dashboard in Microsoft Azure.  It displays the location of the attackers, as well as the number of attempts.

Applications used - Microsoft Azure, Sentinel, Powershell, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Windows Event Viewer, and Geolocation API tool.
